Other tests I used

There were a lot of different cases I had to account for. Unlike our previous assignments, there isn't a specific format for them to abide by and they had more freedom with their input. 

Syntax Errors:
I had to account for wrong inputs such as redirects without operators, trailing and leading pipes, and mistypes commands.
