Other tests I used

There were a lot of different cases I had to account for. Unlike our previous assignments, there isn't a specific format for the user to abide by and they have more freedom with their input. 

Syntax Errors:
I had to account for wrong inputs such as redirects without operators, trailing and leading pipes, and mistyped commands.
Some examples of these tests were "ls -la |", "ls -la >", and "< ls -la". There are a lot of mistakes a user can make when typing command
and it was difficult accounting for all of them.

Spacing:
Initially, I thought the task would be simple. Delimit by spacing and then exec. However, with then echo built in, we had to preserve the spacing
and make every other command ignore them. Some tests I considered where "ls                 -la | wc -l", and "          ". Additionally, 
identifying what the exact syntax error was and giving the user an informative error message also presented a challenge.
